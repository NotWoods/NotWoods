Hi, I'm Tiger! I'm a developer from Hawaii, living in Seattle.

I've helped build 3 web browsers and hundreds of open source projects, including Firefox for Android and [Maskable.app](https://maskable.app). You can see some more of those [projects](https://tigeroakes.com/projects/) on my website or read my [blog](https://tigeroakes.com/posts/)!

If you’d like to get in touch or if you have questions about my work, don’t hesitate to [contact me](https://tigeroakes.com/#contact).
